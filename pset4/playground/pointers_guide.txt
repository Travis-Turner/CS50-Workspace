///----POINTERS GUIDE

* When we pass a value to a function, we really pass a copy of the value
* If we instead pass a pointer, we can pass the actual variable to a function

***** MEMORY RECAP (non-DRY version)
 - int = 4 bytes of memory in RAM
 - char = 1 byte of memory in RAM
 - float = 4 bytes of memory in RAM
 - double = 8 bytes of memory in RAM
 - long long = 8 bytes of memory in RAM
 - char* = 4 or 8 bytes of memory in RAM
 - all pointers are 4 or 8 bytes of RAM

 ** A pointer is a data item whose value is a memory address
 ** The type indicated the type of data stored at the point

 * & can be used to extract the address location of an already existing variable

 int x;
 &x; - value of address of x
